# YoutubeDL

Mandatory for the tool to work :

- Apache2
- PHP7 or above
- yt-dlp ----> https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation
- ffmpeg and ffprobe (generally already installed)

Put the folder YoutubeDL at the root directory of your apache server (e.g /var/www/html/ for ubuntu and some others)

You can then connect to the tool from anywhere in your local network by typing in your URL bar : <ip_adress_of_the_machine_where_the_tool_is_installed>/youtubedl/url.php or http://localhost/youtubedl/url.php if you connect directly from the machine the tool is installed.

You can also access the tool remotely from outside your local network if apache is configured so.

You can send me an email if necessary contact@arpenid.com

Enjoy.
